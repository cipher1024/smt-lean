There is a corresponding environment variable for every option.
The names of those environment variables are the long name of options, prefixed
by VERIT_, upcased, and with each '-' replaced by '_'.  Such a non-zero
environment variable sets the boolean option.  For integer and string options,
the interpretation is natural.
Command line options override environment variables.

Please notice that symbol names beginning with veriT__ or ?veriT__ are
reserved.
